= Lab1 - Automating Deployments Using Pipelines
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this lab you will learn about pipelines and how to configure a pipeline in OpenShift so
that it will take care of the application lifecycle.

== Background: Continuous Integration and Pipelines

A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software
from version control right through to your users and customers.
Every change to your software (committed in source control) goes through a complex process on
its way to being released. This process involves building the software in a reliable and repeatable
manner, as well as progressing the built software (called a "build") through multiple stages of
testing and deployment.

OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution for building pipelines using https://tekton.dev/[Tekton]. Tekton is a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating deployments across multiple platforms (Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, etc) by abstracting away the underlying details.

== Understanding Tekton

Tekton defines a number of https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Kubernetes custom resources] as building blocks in order to standardize pipeline concepts and provide a terminology that is consistent across CI/CD solutions. 

The custom resources needed to define a pipeline are listed below:

* `Task`: a reusable, loosely coupled number of steps that perform a specific task (e.g. building a container image)
* `Pipeline`: the definition of the pipeline and the `Tasks` that it should perform
* `TaskRun`: the execution and result of running an instance of task
* `PipelineRun`: the execution and result of running an instance of pipeline, which includes a number of `TaskRuns`

image::tekton-architecture.png[Tekton Architecture]

In short, in order to create a pipeline, one does the following:

* Create custom or install https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog[existing] reusable `Tasks`
* Create a `Pipeline` and `PipelineResources` to define your application's delivery pipeline
* Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to provide the volume/filesystem for pipeline execution or provide a `VolumeClaimTemplate` which creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim`
* Create a `PipelineRun` to instantiate and invoke the pipeline

For further details on pipeline concepts, refer to the https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/master/docs#learn-more[Tekton documentation] that provides an excellent guide for understanding various parameters and attributes available for defining pipelines.


== Production vs. Development

In a real project on OpenShift, _dev_, _test_ and _production_ environments would typically use different OpenShift projects and perhaps even different OpenShift clusters.

For simplicity in this scenario we will use a only one environment, and no _dev_, _test_ or _prod_ environment.

=== 1. Create a database

you can create a database using the following via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{ USER_ID }}-inventory && \
oc new-app -e POSTGRESQL_USER=catalog \
             -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
             -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=catalog \
             openshift/postgresql:latest \
             --name=catalog-database
----

You can log into the running Postgres container using the following via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc rsh deployment/catalog-database
----

Once logged in, use the following commands to execute an SQL statement to insert content to the database and then exit:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
psql -U catalog;   
----


[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS catalog;

CREATE TABLE catalog (
  itemId VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(256),
  description VARCHAR(2560),
  price DOUBLE PRECISION
);


insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('329299', 'Quarkus T-shirt', '', 10.00);
insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('329199', 'Pronounced Kubernetes', '', 9.00);
insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('165613', 'Knit socks', '',4.15);
insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('165614', 'Quarkus H2Go water bottle', '', 14.45);
insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('165954', 'Patagonia Refugio pack 28L', '', 6.00);
insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('444434', 'Red Hat Impact T-shirt', '', 9.00);
insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('444435', 'Quarkus twill cap', '',13.00 );
insert into catalog (itemId, name, description, price) values ('444437', 'Nanobloc Universal Webcam Cover', '', 2.75);
----

Log out of the database
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
exit;
----

Exit from the pod sesion
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
exit
----

=== 2. Create pipeline and deploy Catalog app

In the developer view go to +Add --> Import from Git 

Fill in the fields, click on Show advanced Git options, and click `Create`:

image::import-from-git-1.png[import-from-git-1, 1000]

* Git Repo URL: https://github.com/pkstaz/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs.git
* Git reference: ocp-4.10
* Context dir: /catalog

[NOTE]
====
The assistant will recognized and recommend the image for the app code 
====

image::import-from-git-2.png[import-from-git-2, 1000]

* Application: Create Application
* Application name: catalog
* Name: catalog-app
* Select the resource type to generate: Deployment 


image::import-from-git-3.png[import-from-git-3, 1000]

* Check Add Pipelines
* Target Port: 8080
* Check Create a route to the Application

You can see the pipeline run in the Pipelines menu.

image::pipeline-run.png[pipeline-run, 1000]


[NOTE]
====
Wait 2-3 minutes for the deployment to finish.
For the next step is important that you pipeline is done.
====

Go to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-inventory[Topology View^] to see the elements that were deployed.

The Topology view in the Developer perspective of the web console provides a visual representation of all the applications within a project, their build status, and the components and services associated with them.

Label the components so that they get proper icons by running this command in the CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{USER_ID}}-inventory && \
oc label deployment/catalog-database app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/catalog-app app.openshift.io/runtime=spring-boot --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/catalog-database app.kubernetes.io/part-of=catalog --overwrite && \
oc label deployment/catalog-app app.kubernetes.io/part-of=catalog --overwrite && \
oc annotate deployment/catalog-app app.openshift.io/connects-to=catalog-database --overwrite && \
oc annotate deployment/catalog-app app.openshift.io/vcs-uri=https://github.com/pkstaz/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs.git --overwrite && \
oc annotate deployment/catalog-app app.openshift.io/vcs-ref=ocp-4.10 --overwrite
----


=== 3. Verify Catalog App

Visit the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-inventory[Topology View^] to see the inventory app (and its database). The *Topology* view in the _Developer_ perspective of the OpenShift web console provides a visual representation of all the applications within a project, their build status, and the components and services associated with them. You'll visit this often:

image::catalog-app-topology.png[crw,700]

Verify that you can access the Catalog App by clicking on the route link (the arrow) to access the running catalog-app:

image::route-link-catalog-app.png[crw,300]

The catalog web interface should look like:

image::catalog-app-web-interface.png[crw,900]
